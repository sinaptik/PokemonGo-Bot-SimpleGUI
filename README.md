# Soft Bans 
## Rules of Thumb
- If you start in a location, don't move too many miles from that location within a short amount of time.
- if you jump continents within 1-2 hours, this will also result in a soft ban.
- *for now Incense and Lucky Egg's cause instant soft bans (with botting)

## What are Soft Bans?
- soft bans are a GPS anti-hack system made by niantic in order to avoid people jumping from place to play. They let you play but with restrictions.
- if you are soft banned, you will recognize that your pokemon will run away everytime, and that you won't get anything from pokestops.
- a soft ban usually takes 20min - 1 hour, wait during that time and don't move to a new location to get soft banned again!
